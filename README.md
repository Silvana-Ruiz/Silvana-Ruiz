Hello, my name is Silvana and I am studying a B.S. in Computer Science and Technology. I am currently working with pyhton, C++, R, and Matlab. I am interested in learning more about bioinformatics as well as artificial intelligence and data science. My pronouns are she/her. I speak spanish (native), english (advanced), and german (beginner). In my free time I like to listen to music, write, draw, pratice calligraphy, and watch k-dramas (my favorite is Crash Landing on You).
I would love to learn from others and collaborate in proyects that help solve problems that people face on a daily basis.
